# Design Document

## Overview

The Pest and Disease Identification Guide feature extends the CropVision application by adding image-based plant health diagnosis capabilities. This feature integrates with third-party image recognition APIs (Plant.id, Google Vision AI, or Microsoft Azure Custom Vision) to analyze uploaded plant images and provide pest/disease identification with treatment recommendations.

The design builds upon the existing React/TypeScript frontend and FastAPI/Python backend architecture, adding new components for image handling, API integration, and result display while maintaining the current user experience patterns.

## Architecture

### System Architecture
The feature integrates into the existing three-tier architecture:

1. **Frontend Layer (React/TypeScript)**
   - New ImageUpload component for photo capture/upload
   - PestDiseaseResults component for displaying identification results
   - Integration with existing navigation and layout components

2. **Backend Layer (FastAPI/Python)**
   - New image processing endpoint for handling uploads
   - Third-party API integration for image recognition
   - Pest/disease database management and lookup
   - Image storage and optimization utilities

3. **External Services**
   - Plant.id API (primary choice for plant-specific identification)
   - Google Vision AI (fallback option)
   - Cloud storage for uploaded images (optional)

### Integration Points
- New `/identify` API endpoint for image processing
- Integration with existing navigation system
- Utilizes current styling system (Tailwind CSS)
- Follows existing error handling patterns

## Components and Interfaces

```

**Responsibilities:**
- Handle file selection and drag-drop functionality
- Provide camera access on mobile devices
- Image preview and validation

        self.api_key = api_key
        self.base_url = "https://api.plant.id/v2"
    
    async def identify_disease(self, image_data: bytes) -> dict:
        """Send image to Plant.id for disease identification"""
        payload = {
            "api_key": self.api_key,
            "images": [base64.b64encode(image_data).decode()],
            "modifiers": ["crops_fast", "similar_images"],

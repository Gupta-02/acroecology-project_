# Requirements Document

## Introduction

The Soil Type Analysis feature enhances the existing crop recommendation system by incorporating soil characteristics into the decision-making process. This feature allows farmers to input their specific soil type and receive tailored recommendations for soil amendments, irrigation schedules, and crop varieties that are best suited for their soil conditions. By considering soil properties alongside crop preferences, the system can provide more accurate and actionable agricultural advice.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1

**User Story:** As a farmer, I want to select my soil type from predefined options, so that I can receive recommendations tailored to my specific soil conditions.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a user accesses the crop recommendation form THEN the system SHALL display a soil type selection field
2. WHEN a user clicks on the soil type field THEN the system SHALL present predefined options: "Sandy", "Clay", "Loamy", "Silty", "Peaty", "Chalky"
3. WHEN a user selects a soil type THEN the system SHALL store the selection for use in recommendations
4. IF no soil type is selected THEN the system SHALL provide general recommendations without soil-specific advice

### Requirement 2

**User Story:** As a farmer, I want to receive crop recommendations that consider both my chosen crop and soil type, so that I can make informed decisions about what to plant.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a user submits a recommendation request with both crop type and soil type THEN the system SHALL generate recommendations based on both parameters
2. WHEN the system processes a soil-crop combination THEN it SHALL suggest appropriate crop varieties suited for that soil type
3. WHEN displaying recommendations THEN the system SHALL include soil-specific growing tips and variety suggestions
4. IF a crop is not well-suited for the selected soil type THEN the system SHALL warn the user and suggest alternatives

### Requirement 3

**User Story:** As a farmer, I want to receive soil amendment recommendations based on my soil type and chosen crop, so that I can improve my soil conditions for better yields.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a user receives crop recommendations THEN the system SHALL include soil amendment suggestions specific to their soil type
2. WHEN the system suggests amendments THEN it SHALL provide specific products or materials to add to the soil
3. WHEN displaying amendment recommendations THEN the system SHALL include application rates and timing guidance
4. IF the selected crop requires specific soil conditions THEN the system SHALL prioritize amendments that support those requirements

### Requirement 4

**User Story:** As a farmer, I want to receive irrigation recommendations based on my soil type, so that I can optimize water usage and plant health.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a user receives recommendations THEN the system SHALL include irrigation guidance specific to their soil type
2. WHEN the system provides irrigation advice THEN it SHALL specify frequency, duration, and method recommendations
3. WHEN dealing with sandy soils THEN the system SHALL recommend more frequent, shorter watering sessions
4. WHEN dealing with clay soils THEN the system SHALL recommend less frequent, deeper watering sessions
5. IF the crop has specific water requirements THEN the system SHALL adjust irrigation recommendations accordingly

### Requirement 5

**User Story:** As a system administrator, I want to maintain a comprehensive soil types database, so that the system can provide accurate soil-specific recommendations.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the system initializes THEN it SHALL load soil type data including characteristics, suitable crops, amendments, and irrigation guidelines
2. WHEN storing soil type information THEN the system SHALL include soil name, characteristics, best-suited crops, recommended amendments, and irrigation suggestions
3. WHEN updating soil data THEN the system SHALL validate data integrity and relationships
4. IF soil data is missing or corrupted THEN the system SHALL log errors and fall back to general recommendations

### Requirement 6

**User Story:** As a farmer, I want the soil type selection to work seamlessly on mobile devices, so that I can use the system while working in the field.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a user accesses the form on a mobile device THEN the soil type selection SHALL be easily tappable and readable
2. WHEN the dropdown opens on mobile THEN it SHALL not be obscured by the keyboard or other UI elements
3. WHEN a user makes a selection on mobile THEN the interface SHALL provide clear visual feedback
4. IF the user rotates their device THEN the soil type selection SHALL remain functional and properly positioned
